Frequently when scanning 2 products (for example shoe   carrier bag only carrier bag appears) the first won't appear in the cart and has to be scanned a second time, unsure why this happens but it has been an issue and caused accidental double charging on 1 product.It would be helpful for the store IDP/address to show automatically as we have to type it in every time."

It usually happens at an inconvenient time like when you are in the middle of a transaction. Is there any way to make it so that this is only prompted at the beginning of a shift? Also there are a lot of steps to log in. May I suggest skipping through screen that has you type in your fossil email since we have to reenter our numbers on the next screen anyway. Finally, the time that a screen remains open when left idle is too short to complete a lot of tasks- e.g closing the register. We are not given enough time to count the money. The screen will close and then when we reopen the screen and type in the closing dollar amount it glitches out and the register wont close. We have to exit out of the screen and start the closing process over"

Just a Very long slow system that is basically a downgrade from the old yet simple and faster registers and systems.
